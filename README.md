# Openshift TektonCD operator

This repository holds Openshift's fork of
[`tektoncd/operator`](https://github.com/tektoncd/operator) with additions and
fixes needed only for the OpenShift side of things.

## How this repository works ?

The `master` branch holds up-to-date specific [openshift files](./openshift)
that are necessary for CI setups and maintaining it. This includes:

- Scripts to create a new release branch from `upstream`
- CI setup files
  - tests scripts

Each release branch holds the upstream code for that release and our
openshift's specific files.

## CI Setup

For the CI setup, two repositories are of importance:

- This repository
- [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release) which
  contains the configuration of CI jobs that are run on this
  repository

All of the following is based on OpenShiftâ€™s CI operator
configs. General understanding of that mechanism is assumed in the
following documentation.
